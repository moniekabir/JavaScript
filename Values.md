# Values and variables
Values are the simplest components in JavaScript. 1 is a value, true is a value, "hello" is a value, function() {} is a value, the list goes on! There are a handful of different 
types of values in JavaScript but we don't need to go over them all right away â€” you will learn them naturally the more you code!
