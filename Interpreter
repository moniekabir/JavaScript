If you simply type a variable name into the console it will print out the value stored in that variable. A note about variables is that by default they go away when you switch to
a different page. If I were to hit the Refresh button in Chrome, for example, my dogSentence variable would get wiped and it would be like it never existed.
But don't worry about this too much for now â€” you can just hit the up or down arrows on your keyboard while in the console to go through everything you've entered in recently.
